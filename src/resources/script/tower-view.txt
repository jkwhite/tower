A warm breeze stirs the grass and dry earth of the valley around you.

The valley floor is composed of mottled patches of living and dead grass,
broken by the occasional scattered stand of trees that must have once formed
an orchard.

Glints of metal through the grasses betray cast-off jetsam strewn haphazardly,
the discarded junk of a vanished people.

Toward the north, the Tower looms skyward. Its ruined, decaying outer walls
form a porous shell that defies any notion of structural integrity
for the bulk of the edifice it seems to support.

Toward the east, you spot a collection of low buildings that must be a town.
