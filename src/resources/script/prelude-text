Many years ago in forgotten ages,
there lived an ancient people
who achieved mastery over all the earth
and built many things of wonder.

But their most wondrous achievement
was the construction of the Tower -
a structure of immeasurable proportion
linking together the earth and its moon.

Legends say that those ancient people
grew capricious and careless in their mastery.
In despair, they abandoned the earth
when it first started to die.

Now with its mythical creators long vanished
and the means to control it lost to time,
the crumbling Tower stands dark and silent,
yet still reaching upward seemingly forever.

But there are those who say that the Tower
can still be traversed, and that the key
to reviving the earth lies at the other end
of that labyrinthine aethereal path...
