9 Aurel

The generator went out this morning and I found we are
out of potatoes. Father should be back tomorrow from
Wells, hopefully with more supplies. I suppose I
shall sleep on the roof tonight, just in case.

I keep thinking about the look in Father's eyes on the
day that he left. He knows that our life here cannot continue.
But he's too stubborn to move. Or admit it to me. He should
know that I am no longer a child.

I think this will be my last entry for a while. Paper and ink
both are running out. The last caravan was in early Amoene.
Father returned last night with only a few supplies. He said
Wells is abandoned. Even Old Benija was gone.

Father told me we shall have to travel east to Anhan if the Waste
encroaches further. Odd. I think he is shaken. And I think we
should take our chances in the Tower, but Father doesn't trust it.
But then Father doesn't trust anything anymore after what happened
to Mother.

The right thing to do is to stay with Father. I should do the
right thing, right?

I have made my decision. Father, forgive me.
