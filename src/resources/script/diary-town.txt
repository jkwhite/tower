I think this will be my last entry for a while. Paper and ink
both are running out. The last caravan was three months ago now.
Father returned from Fallen Leaf last night with only a few
supplies. He said it is abandoned. Even Old Benija was gone.

Father says we shall have to travel east if the Waste encroaches
further. I think we should take our chances in the Tower, but
Father doesn't trust it. But then Father doesn't trust anything
anymore after what happened to Mother.

The right thing to do is to stay with Father. I should do the
right thing, right?
