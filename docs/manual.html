<p><h1><a name="preface">0. Preface</a></h1></p>
<p><i>I</i> am writing this for <i>your</i> benefit. I. You. How odd.
I'm no solipsist, but I still don't get it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><h1><a name="us">1. Us</a></h1></p>
<p>There is no Us, there is only You. <i>You</i> are a traveller.</p>
<p><h2><a name="professions">Professions</a></h2></p>
<p>Upon entering the Tower, you may choose a profession. The profession you choose
will affect the kind of strategies you will invoke to navigate the Tower. Each
profession represents a different starting point in terms of strengths and
weaknesses. Given enough expended energy, all professions can learn all skills,
so they converge to the same unified strength. (Or so I predict. Truth is
I've never observed anyone reach that point.) Each profession has a set of
starting <a href="#attributes">attributes</a> and <a href="#skills">skills</a>.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct profession to match your play style is <i>incredibly important</i>
and should not be underestimated. In fact, your choice will most likely affect
the choices you make in your real life outside of Tower. <b><i>Choosing a profession
should only be attempted by a trained professionologist. Please consult your physician
or spiritual guide.</i></b></p>
<p><h3>Archeologist</h3></p>
<p>Archeologists have a bit of skill in everything, making them very balanced
adventurers. They automatically recognize valuable gems. Difficulty: moderate</p>
<p><h3>Barbarian</h3></p>
<p>Barbarians have no need for fanciful special abilities or complex
strategies, for they more than compensate with brute force. In fact, most
Barbarians stopped reading after the word 'Barbarian'. Difficulty: light</p>
<p><h3>Ranger</h3></p>
<p>Rangers are more skilled at bows and throwing weapons than melee combat.
They are most well-known for their uncanny ability to set and disarm
traps. All that time alone in the wilderness has also stilled their minds, making
them quite skilled at detecting secret doors and hidden structures. Difficulty: light</p>
<p><h3>Tinkerer</h3></p>
<p>Depending on who you ask, Tinkerers are either eccentric geniuses or insane recluses.
As always, the truth lies somewhere in between: they are eccentric genius recluses with
bouts of insanity.
While Tinkerers can build simple traps, their main skills involve constructing
intricate structures and mechanical creatures. Generally very poor at direct combat,
Tinkerers prefer to outwit, outmaneuver, or overpower enemies with their clever
devices and robotic underlings. Difficulty: hard</p>
<p><h3>Alchemist</h3></p>
<p>Alchemists spend their lives in solitary pursuit of riches and knowledge.
Their ability to automatically recognize all potions greatly aids anticipating
the effects of chemical reactions. Alchemists must rely on their wits to
survive, as their study leaves little time for combat practice.
Difficulty: very hard</p>
<p><h3>Priest</h3></p>
<p>More than any other profession, priests are in tune with the world around them.
Priets can automatically detect blessed or cursed items. If a priest can
overcome his initial condition, he can become quite powerful. Priests are
also adept at <a href="#scribing">writing scrolls</a>. Difficulty:
hard</p>
<p><h1><a name="them">2. Them</a></h1></p>
<p>"They" take on many guises. They are animals, monsters, robots,
fellow humans, elves, orcs, shopkeepers, and townsfolk. There are also other,
forgotten races, who have carved out various niches within the space
of the Tower.</p>
<p><h2>Animals</h2></p>
<p>Animals initially show no particular loyalty to anyone. However, they
can be <a href="#taming">tamed</a>, usually with an offering of a tasty treat. Species of animals
include dogs, cats (who like balls of yarn), pandas, and guinea pigs.</p>
<p><h2>Monsters</h2></p>
<p>Monsters generally look out for themselves and their own, and are
hostile toward any creature who enters their territory. Players are
<i>especially</i> tasty. Unfortunately, most denizens of the Tower are
monsters. It can't be helped, really. Got to look out for #1.</p>
<p><h2>Robots</h2></p>
<p>Robots act on decisions computed by their processors based on their
perceived inputs. I only explicitly mention this fact to give you some
semblance of superiority over those you perceive to be rote automatons.</p>
<p>Some people <a href="#buildrobots">build robots</a>. Robots constructed
by the player will be friendly to
the player and hostile to monsters. Contrarily, robots constructed by
monsters will be hostile to the player.</p>
<p><h2><a name="shopkeeper">Shopkeepers</a></h2></p>
<p>Shopkeepers tend their stores, providing needed goods to travellers
in exchange for gold, which they hoard in the pursuit of unknown ends.
I have befriended many shopkeepers over the course of my journeys, and one
defining trait threads like an eternal golden braid through each one: a
fanatical fastidiousness to discipline and design. Shopkeepers are quick to
anger and long to forgive. But treat them with respect, and not steal items
from their shops, or use underlings to do so, or dig into their walls, and
your relationship will grow reciprocally.</p>
<p><h1><a name="items">3. Items</a></h1></p>
<p><h2><a name="armor">Armor</a></h2></p>
<p>Armor is the last thing between you and the end of <strike>the world</strike>you.
(Like I said, I'm no solipsist.) Stronger armors, like iron and steel, will grant
you more protection, but can also increase your <a href="#encumbrance">encumbrance</a>
and decrease your <a href="#quickness">quickness</a>, either of which will make you
easier to hit. Your choice of armor will usually depend on your profession.</p>
<p><h2><a name="comestible">Comestibles</a></h2></p>
<p>Comestibles, or foodstuffs, provide sustenance to sustain your
corporeal body on its long journey. All comestibles spoil after
some time if not preserved or <a href="#lyophilizer">freeze-dried</a>.
Fruit, vegatables, and meat spoil fairly quickly. Rations, in contrast,
are designed to remain palatable for extended periods. Keep this in
mind when choosing your next meal.</p>
<p><h2><a name="gem">Gems</a></h2></p>
<p>Rare jewels can significantly contribute to your score. The trick
is identifying which gems are valuable, and which are just poor
imitations.</p>
<p>Stones are also classified under gems due to approximate physical
similarity.</p>
<p><b>Rock</b> - Hefty stone, a common byproduct of <a href="#dig">digging</a></p>
<p><b>Small stone</b> - Useful as slingshot ammunition</p>
<p><b>Sharpening stone</b> - Stone that can be <a href="#apply">used</a> to keep weapons sharp</p>
</p>
<p><h2><a name="junk">Junk</a></h2></p>
<p>Anything not fitting into the above categories becomes junk.
While junk is a superset of flotsam and jetsam, some junk can
be used to <a href="#buildrobots">build robots</a> and
<a href="#construction">structures</a>.</p>
<p><h2><a name="pill">Pills</a></h2></p>
<p>Pills contain "transformative essence" or nutrients in solid form. Compared
to potions, pills are much lighter, and thus many more pills can be carried than
potions without incurring significant <a href="#encumbrance">encumbrance</a>. However,
pills will dissolve on contact with water. Because of this, <a href="#dip">dipping</a>
a pill into a potion of water creates a potion of the same transformative effect. On
the down side, pills carried on your person when entering a pool or stream will
dissolve. I have also noted that the naturally-occuring forms of certain transformatives
tend of favor either potion or pill form over the inverse.</p>
<p><h2><a name="potion">Potions</a></h2></p>
<p>Potions contain "transformative essence" in liquid form. Amongst other
actions, otions may be <a href="#quaff">quaffed</a>, <a href="#throw">thrown</a>,
or <a href="#pour">poured</a>. Other items can be <a href="#dip">dipped</a> in
potions to imbue them with the potion's transformative effects. Be warned that potions
can freeze or shatter.</p>
<p><h2><a name="scroll">Scrolls</a></h2></p>
<p>Scrolls are written incantations that can produce a variety
of effects, from summoning monsters, to uncursing items, to
even erupting in a deadly, scorching fire. When traveling through
watery environs, be sure to <a href="#laminate">laminate</a> your
collection of scrolls. Scrolls are created through <a href="#scribing">scribing</a>.</p>
<p><h2><a name="tool">Tools</a></h2></p>
<p>Tools come in a wide variety, from batteries and buckets of paint
to torches and flashlights. Tools can be <a href="#apply">applied</a>
to many situations. A pick-axe, for example, can be applied
to hack a <a href="#lyophilizer">lyophilizer</a> to bits in order
to extract the valuable <a href="#battery">battery</a> contained
within.</p>
<p>Some important kinds of tools are listed here. Make note.</p>
<p><b><a name="battery">Battery</a></b> - Recharges any battery-powered device, including <a href="#wands">wands</a>,
<a href="#laser">lasers</a>, <a href="#lyophilizer">lyophilizers</a>. Also frequently used
in <a href="#buildrobots">robotics</a>.</p>
<p><b><a name="yarn">Ball of yarn</a></b> - Toss at kittens or tigers, or use as reinforcement</p>
<p><b><a name="blindfold">Blindfold</a></b> - Cover your eyes</p>
<p><b>Laminating kit</b> - Prevent the ink on <a href="#scroll">scrolls</a> or
<a href="#books">books</a> from dissolving on contact with <a href="#water">water</a></p>
<p><b>Pick-axe</b> - Dig through walls, carve new passageways, or destroy structures</p>
<p><b>Reinforcing kit</b> - Increase <a href="#armor">armor</a> strength
or prevent <a href="#potion">potions</a> from freezing and shattering. Requires
a reinforcing material, like <a href="#yarn">yarn</a>.</p>
<p><h2><a name="wands">Wands</a></h2></p>
<p>Wands are powerful beam weapons. They are <a href="#battery">battery</a>-powered. Due
to their high power consumption, three or four zaps is enough to drain a fully-charged battery.
The most common types of wands deal in elemental forces, like fire, ice, and lightning. However,
rarer species of wands exist, and their distinct behaviors cannot be so easily classified.</p>
<p><h2><a name="weapons">Weapons</a></h2></p>
<p>Weaponry is a practical necessity for a mortal like you, especially in a dangerous
place like the Tower. Fortunately--or unfortunately--weapons are in no short supply here.
What can't be bought in the shops can be looted from fallen enemies. Knives and daggers
of flickering swiftness, maces and hammers of face-stomping authority, slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune, or poisoned darts of pleasure: all can be had for a price.</p>
<p>Most weapons are blunted and made useless by extended use. It's important to 
<a href="#gem">hone</a> a weapon's edge from time to time.</p>
<p><h1><a name="structures">4. Structures</a></h1></p>
<p><h2><a name="altar">Altars</a></h2></p>
<p>Altars may be sentient. Or perhaps they are gods, for they certainly
enjoy sacrifice. Altars respond only when a scroll is read in their
vicinity after the required sacrificial items have been placed upon them.
All sacrifices require at least one corpse of a monster. Those rituals
I have discovered are listed here. I am certain there are more.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><u>Sacrificial Items</u></td><td><u>Scroll</u></td><td><u>Gift</u></td></tr>
<tr><td>Corpses</td><td>Summoning</td><td>Transmogrified creature summoned</td></tr>
<tr><td>Corpses, potion of tunneling</td><td>Tunneling</td><td>Tunnel</td></tr>
</table>
<p><h2><a name="basin">Basins</a></a></h2></p>
<p>Basins store liquids, and can be used to <a href="#alchemy">mix</a>
or create potions.</p>
<p><h2><a name="fabricator">Fabricators</a></h2></p>
<p>Fabricators appear to be related to shrines in that they are immobile and
atomic. Put simply, fabricators eat corpses. Once consumed, the fabricator
may be used to generate living copies of all consumed creatures. If there
is a limit on the number of copies, I haven't found it. I have been unable
to determine the source of a fabricator's energy. I fear it is being
plundered from some secret universe, and I no longer use fabricators.</p>
<p><h2><a name="lever">Levers</a></h2></p>
<p>I can't give you any generalization around levers. When
<a href="#apply">applied</a>, each one may have an entirely
different effect.</p>
<p><h2><a name="lyophilizer">Lyophilizers</a></h2></p>
<p>These wonderful battery-powered devices will freeze-dry perishable
foodstuffs into lightweight, long-lasting nutrient pills.</p>
<p><h2><a name="shop">Shops</a></h2></p>
<p>Shops are run by <a href="#shopkeeper">shopkeepers</a> and lay scattered
throughout the Tower.</p>
<p>To buy an item, pick it up. The price will be automatically deducted
from your coins as you leave the shop. (You <i>do</i> have enough to pay,
right?) To sell an item, drop it on the shop floor and the shopkeeper will
quote you a price.</p>
<p><h2><a name="shrine">Shrines</a></h2></p>
<p>Shrines are stranges boxes that can somehow cyclically modulate
an item's status. A cursed pineapple, when placed in a shrine, will
become an uncursed pineapple after the prescribed length of time. If
left in the shrine, it will continue to become a blessed pineapple,
then return to a cursed pineapple. Note that any item's status may
be affected, not just that of pineapples. There are two kinds of shrines,
distinguished by their tones. Short-toned shrines cycle in the manner
described above, and long-toned shrines cycle withershindishwise.
If there is any means to move a shrine, or to construct one from
raw materials, it is beyond my ken. Like <a href="#altar">altars</a>
and <a href="#fabricator">fabricators</a>, they seem to be relics
of an age long past.</p>
<p><h2><a name="tunnel">Tunnels</a></h2></p>
<p>Tunnels connect non-contiguous spaces. For the most part, tunnels
also strech between floors, thus providing a quick means of traversing
sections of the Tower that would otherwise take a significant amount
of time to cross. Tunnels seem to indicate that the Tower is a
multiply-connected space.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I spoke with an old soldier from the Syndicate force,
who had retired to Old Town. (This was obviously in the days before
the area was occupied by troglodytes.) He claimed to know of a
tunnel that not only spanned fifteen floors, but fifteen years as well.
This may suggest some kind of symmetry between space and time,
although I have not the time to speculate further.</p>
<p><h1><a name="skills">5. Skills</a></h1></p>
<p><h2><a name="taming">Taming</a></h2></p>
<p>Animals will follow you and help you in exchange for a bite to eat.
Don't be shy--<a href="#throw">throw</a> that tasty treat right at it!
It's generally good behavior to <a href="#call">call</a> your pet some
name after you've tamed it.</p>
<p><h2><a name="weaponskills">Weapon skills</a></h2></p>
<p>Every weapon falls into a category, and each category corresponds to
a weapon skill. The basic categories are unarmed, one-handed edged,
one-handed crushing, two-handed edged, two-handed crushing, bows,
pole-arms, and guns. More exotic weaponry may fall into additional
categories.</p>
<p><h2><a name="armorskills">Armor skills</a></h2></p>
<p>Every piece of armor falls into a category, and each category
corresponds to an armor skill. The basic categories are unarmored,
cloth, light leather, heavy leather, chain, and plate. More exotic
armors may fall into additional categories.</p>
<p><h2><a name="buildrobots">Robotics</a></h2></p>
<p class="key">#robotics</p>
<p>Building robot underlings can be a satisfying and rewarding experience.
Let me emphasise the word <b>underlings</b>. Nothing ruins the fun quite
so much as switching on a two-ton steel-plated mobile killing machine with
<i>laser guns for eyes</i> as realizing it thinks you'll provide an
excellent opportunity to verify its sighting algorithms.</p>
<p>The easiest way to obtain robot parts is from other robots. Not that
they will necessarily hand them over without a fight, of course. I've
also seen robot parts for sale in salvage shops and junkyards.</p>
<p>The simplest known robot is the gridbug.</p>
<p><h2><a name="alchemy">Alchemy</a></h2></p>
<p class="key">#pour</p>
<p>Alchemy is a difficult and arcane science. (Some would question
whether it should be called a science. In my studies, I have found it
obeys certain basic rules, and so its effects are predictable. For
that reason I call it a science.)</p>
<p>At its simplest level, an alchemical reaction occurs as the result
of mixing the contents of two <a href="#potion">potions</a>.
There are three possible outcomes
to any basic alchemical reaction: a mixture, a reaction, or a violent
reaction. In a mixture, the substances coexist peacefully. In a
reaction, a new, stable substance is created. In a violent reaction,
a new, highly-excitable substance is created just long enough for it to
blow up a spectacular manner sure to amuse those outside the blast radius.</p>
<p>Some basic combinations are listed here.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><u>Ingredients</u></td><td><u>Reaction</u></td><td><u>Result</u></td></tr>
<tr><td>Blindness, water</td><td>stable</td><td>Healing</td></tr>
<tr><td>Confusion, blindness</td><td>mixture</td><td>Confusion and blindness</td></tr>
<tr><td>Water, lightning</td><td>unstable</td><td>Something</td></tr>

<p><h2><a name="animatronics">Animatronics</a></h2></p>
<p>Animatronics is a simpler, creepier alternative to robotics.
The key ingredient to all animatronics is a corpse of the creature
that will be animated. I once created an army of animatronic rats
in my younger days. I still have nightmares. <b>Key:&nbsp;#robotics</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="scribing">Scribing</a></h2></p>
<p>Scribing is the process of writing a scroll. In addition to a blank
parchment, scribing requires a catalyst of some kind, normally a
gemstone. <b>Key:&nbsp;#scribe</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="buildtrap">Building traps</a></h2></p>
<p>Traps may be constructed provided you possess the necessary skill
and raw materials, and are adjacent to a physical space suitable for trap
placement. For example, there must be a nearby wall in order to build
a dart trap. <b>Key:&nbsp;#build</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="disarmtrap">Disarming traps</a></h2></p>
<p>If you're up for it, you can try to disarm a trap. Fail, and
you risk setting it off. Intact parts from disarmed traps can be
used in trap construction. <b>Key:&nbsp;^</b></p>
<p><h1><a name="construction">6. Construction</a></h1></p>
<p>Most structures found in Tower can be constructed provided enough raw materials and
skill. For example, constructing a new door requires 3 boards, 7 nails, and
adequate skill in carpentry. <b>Key:&nbsp;#build</b></p>
<p><h1><a name="#actions">7. Actions</a></h1></p>
<p><h2><a name="ascend">Ascend</a></h2></p>
<p>If it's possible to move upward from where you are, this will do it. <b>Key:&nbsp;&lt;</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="apply">Apply</a></h2></p>
<p>Apply applies to tools and applicable devices on the current space, like
<a href="#lyophilizer">lyophilizers</a> and <a href="#lever">levers</a>. <b>Key:&nbsp;a</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="call">Call</a></h2></p>
<p>At times it is convenient to give names to certain creatures. Most commonly this applies
to <a href="#taming">tamed</a> pets, but can be used with any creature.<b>Key:&nbsp;C</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="descend">Descend</a></h2></p>
<p>If it's possible to move downward from where you are, this will do it. <b>Key:&nbsp;&gt;</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="dip">Dip</a></h2></p>
<p>Dipping an item in an aqueous substance imbues the original item with any special
properties of the substance. I cannot begin to count the number of times this technique
has spared my life. I remember the first time I entered the Disputed Zone. I had recovered
a cyanide pill from the body of a fallen soldier, and dipped it in a water potion to create a potion
of cyanide. Knowing that my skill with a broadsword far exceeded my aim with a potion,
I dipped the sword in the potion. The act accomplished, I rounded the corner to find myself
face-to-face with a fearsome invisigoth, his translucent form racing toward me.
One stroke. The sensation didn't reach my brain until his form was falling to the floor.<b>Key:&nbsp;#dip</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="drop">Drop</a></h2></p>
<p>When the collective burden becomes too great, it is necessary to drop the effluvia,
the flotsam, and the jetsam. May also be used to <a href="#shrine">enshrine</a> an item. <b>Key:&nbsp;d</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="#eat">Eat</a></h2></p>
<p>Consuming <a href="#comestible">organic matter</a> is necessary to retain your corporeal form as
constructed from self-same temporal organic matter. In other words, eat or die. You can also
eat <a href="#pill">pills</a>. <b>Key:&nbsp;e</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="#fire">Fire</a></h2></p>
<p>When wielding a missile weapon that does not require ammunition, such as any kind
of laser gun, the weapon can be fired with this command. <b>Key:&nbsp;f</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="#help">Help</a></h2></p>
<p>Displays helpful summary information. <b>Key:&nbsp;?</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="kick">Kick</a></h2></p>
<p>Whether it be destroying doors, moving structures, or forcefully
redirecting the fauna, everyone likes kicking. <b>Key:&nbsp;Ctrl+d</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="#look">Look</a></h2></p>
<p>Looking around reveals a more detailed description of your environs.
Looking is a free action. <b>Key:&nbsp;;</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="#look">Look here</a></h2></p>
<p>Looks at the immediate vicinity. As with look, this is a free action. <b>Key:&nbsp;:</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="open">Open</a></h2></p>
<p>Doors must be opened before they can be traversed. Open may also be used to close
an open door. <b>Key:&nbsp;o</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="previous">Previous</a></h2></p>
<p>Displays the previous narrative message. May be invoked repeatedly to display prior messages. <b>Key:&nbsp;,</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="pickup">Pick up</a></h2></p>
<p>Acquiring items is an essential part of life in the Tower. You can pick up
items from the ground, or from a structure like a <a href="#shrine">shrine</a>. <b>Key:&nbsp;,</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="quaff">Quaff</a></h2></p>
<p>Something good, odd, or terrible might happen when you quaff a <a href="#potion">potion</a>. <b>Key:&nbsp;q</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="read">Read</a></h2></p>
<p>Reading a <a href="#scroll">scroll</a> invokes its effect. <b>Key:&nbsp;r</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="read">Rest</a></h2></p>
<p>Do nothing for one turn. <b>Key:&nbsp;.</b></p>

<p>Takes a screenshot. <b>Key:&nbsp;Ctrl+c</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="search">Search</a></h2></p>
<p>I can certainly tell you that the Tower has many secrets. That much is evident to anyone here.
I suppose you could say that secrets come in two varieties: the mundane, and the transcendental.
Mundane secrets, that are covered here, that can be discovered by physical inspection,
include secret doors, false ends, and invisible passages.
The transcendental variety cannot be conjured on a mere command. <b>Key:&nbsp;s</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="#takeoff">Take off</a></h2></p>
<p>Removes a worn shield or armor. <b>Key:&nbsp;T</b></p>
<p><h2><a name="throw">Throw</a></h2></p>
<p>Throwing is useful in any occasion. Throw food at animals to tame them.
Throw food at hungry enemies to distract
them. Throw food at, say, roaming packs of jackals to turn them on each other.
Throw arrows when your bow is equipped to use the bow to shoot the arrow. The
same goes for crossbows, slings, and other missile weapons with physical
ammunition. Throw a <a href="#potion">potion</a> of confusion at someone to confuse them. <b>Key: t</b></p>

<p><h1><a name="conclusion">10. Conclusion</a></h1></p>
<p>Conclusions are an easy way out. The truth is, there is no conclusion.
There is no final point where you find out the best answer, and who was right
and who was wrong. There is no universal why. But maybe you can find one for
yourself. I'd wish you luck if it existed. Instead: have fun. That's one
thing I'm sure of.</p>
