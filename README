INTRODUCTION

Good evening.


BUILDING
=================================

1. You should be on a POSIX-ish system that has Ruby. I doubt any of
   this works on Windows. Fortunately, every single other modern OS
   is pretty close if not entirely POSIX-conformant. It's not worth
   complicating mu to add Windows support. If you insist, you might
   try Cygwin.
2. Tower uses a new build system called 'mu'. Mu is not generally
   available, so I have included the distribution here as 'mu-1.0.tgz'.
   It's a very standard binary distribution, with bin and lib subdirs.
   Hopefully you know what to do with this.
3. Make sure mu knows about all the dependent libraries and stuff;
   from the root tower directory, run 'mu put repo/*'.
4. From the root tower directory or any subdir, run 'mu app.image'.
   This will build a standalone application tree.
5. Alternatively, run 'mu app.run' to both build (if necessary) and run Tower.
   This should be enough to start. Take a look at src/resources for
   the runtime configuration, which is stored in YAML format, or
   src/main/java for the rest of the code.


GENERATING FONT MODELS
======================

1. Obtain Blender 2.42 or higher. Lesser versions have a fatal python
   font loading bug.
2. Create a tree structure similar to the models/courier directory,
   except replacing "courier" with the name of the font which you
   are about to generate.
3. Copy the generate.py script from models/courier/src/res/models/courier
   to your corresponding directory.
4. cd to said directory and run "./generate.py". Unless you're on a mac,
   you will likely need to change the script header to point to your
   Blender installation location.
5. This'll take a while. Why not have a refreshing glass of rainwater,
   or grain alcohol?
6. Convert models from XML to JME binary format. From the root of your
   model area:
   maven tower:models
7. This will also take some time. Whatever you didn't choose in step 5,
   drink now.
8. Jar the models:
   maven jar
9. Copy the jar to your ~/.tower directory, making that directory if you
   haven't already:
   mkdir ~/.tower
   cp <the-jar-what-I-just-made> ~/.tower
10. To use this font, add a line like this to your ~/.towerrc:
    font=<font name>
